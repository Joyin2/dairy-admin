# 💰 Payment & Ledger Management Module

This module must professionally manage:

* Shop payments
* Delivery agent collections
* Sales records
* Outstanding dues
* Ledger history
* Cash reconciliation

Everything should be traceable, structured, and audit-ready.

# 1️⃣ Main “Payments & Ledger” Dashboard

### 🔹 Summary Cards (Top Section)

* Total Sales (Today / This Month)
* Total Cash Collected

# 2️⃣ Shop Ledger Page

When admin opens a specific shop:

## 🏪 Shop Ledger Details

### Shop Information

* Shop Name
* Owner Name
* Contact
* Route
* Credit Limit
* Opening Balance

---

### 📒 Ledger Table (Auto Generated)

| Date | Invoice No | Route | Batch No | Sale Amount | Paid | Due | Payment Mode | Agent |
| ---- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ----------- | ---- | --- | ------------ | ----- |

System should automatically record:

* Every sale entry
* Every payment received
* Partial payments
* Adjustments
* Returns (if applicable)

---

### Ledger Summary (Bottom Section)

* Total Purchase Amount
* Total Paid Amount
* Current Outstanding Balance
* Last Payment Date

Balance formula:

```

```

Each agent should have a separate ledger:

## 🚚 Agent Ledger Page

### Ledger Table
